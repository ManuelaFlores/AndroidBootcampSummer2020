# Cat Cafe:

## Project Description: 

Pawffee is a up and coming Cat Cafe which is about to open in the upstate New York area.
They serve food items, organic single source coffee imported from farm direct co-ops around the world,
and have partnered with two different local animal shelters. Patrons can order food and drinks and 
interact with the cats which roam freely inside the cafe. They can also arrange to be adopted by a cat,
which involves some adoption fees and paperwork which is routed through the appropriate shelter,
or if they are unable to adopt they can still sign up to sponsor a feline. Sponsorships involve
recurring donations which are attached to a specific cat and corresponding shelter and continue
until the cat is adopted by someone. To sponsor a cat, a patron only need “favorite” the cat in the
list of cats and their credit card is automatically charged.
